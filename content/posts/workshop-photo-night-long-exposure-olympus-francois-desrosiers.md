For this back-to-school, Montréal Photo Club is partnering with François Desrosiers, Technical Sales Executive from Olympus Canada to offer you a free workshop on night photography and long exposure techniques.

Workshop will begin at 6:30PM in front of the Centre des Sciences de Montréal and will be moving across the Vieux Montréal.

We are honoured to have François Desrosiers as presenter for this event. François works since 1987 in photography including almost 30 at Lozeau as Director of Workshops, Speaker, and Instructor. He's still offering his formations alongside his activities at Olympus.
He has done over 20 solo exhibitions and multiple books. He's a passionate self-taught always looking for new photographic experimentations.

The workshop is free and open to all. In order to guarantee its quality, we have to limit the spots available and invite you to confirm your participation.
