# Our mission

The Montréal Photo Club's mission is to bring people together around their shared passion for photography. We strive to be an inclusive group regardless of people's skills, equipment, language,... Everybody is welcome to join us and participate to our events.

# History

The Montréal Photo Club has been founded in 2019 by [Jp Valery](/authors/jp-valery). After a couple of years as the official Unsplash Host for Montréal, he decided to build an organization that would be bigger than himself and something that could be transmitted one day.
