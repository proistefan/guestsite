After the incredible success of the [first edition](/metro-photo-challenge-1), we decided to host a second version of the Métro Photo Challenge a couple of months after.

Improving from the previous edition thanks to the feedback of our participants, we decided to spice up the concept by adding themes to follow.
Therefore, your mission order included this time 4 stations and 4 themes that you could combine in any ways you'd see fit.

_Join us for a photography adventure in the subway of Montréal. Get inspired, meet the community, hone your photo skills, and have fun!<br />
You'll be assigned random metro stations to take pictures of and random teammates to accompany you on that adventure.<br />
This challenge is open to all regardless of your skills and equipment. Come learn from experienced photographers or come share your skills._
